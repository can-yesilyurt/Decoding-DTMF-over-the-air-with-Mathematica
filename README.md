# Decoding-DTMF-over-the-air-with-Mathematica
Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) - Signal Identification using Wolfram Mathematica

DTMF Decoder

1) Modify the first line of the code and choose audio-input-device
   It can be, 
   
   a) just the microphone of the PC/laptop or any external micrpphone. 
      In that case, the code captures and decodes e.g., mobile-phone dial tones over the air
      
   b) output of a software defined radio application such as Gqrx SDR or CubicSDR

2) Run the code
3) Click start button
4) Test by dialing a number with a mobile phone and it should be captured and displayed realtime dynamically.
